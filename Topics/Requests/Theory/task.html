<h2>Requests</h2>
<p>It's high time to refine our Flask skills and learn about a couple of very important concepts. Today, we will talk about <strong>requests</strong>. They may seem rather simple: a client sends a request; a server responds to it and sends a response back. Programming this sequence requires some amount of practical knowledge. We will cover it in this topic. Ready? Go!</p>

<h5 id="requests-and-responses-as-objects">Requests and responses as objects</h5>

<p>Let's talk about the basics first. As you may know, there are two main request types — <code class="language-python">GET</code> and <code class="language-python">POST</code>. Don't forget that these are only the names; HTTP does not oblige you to use <code class="language-python">GET</code> to obtain information and <code class="language-python">POST</code> to forward it. Though that is what is most often implied. With the help of HTTP requests we can send data, receive a response, and establish a connection between our computer and a server via the HTTP protocol. You can say that everything sounds familiar, then why repeat? That's a good point to step in and start discussing Flask features.</p>

<p>All data transmissions in Python are processed as objects. Namely, a request and response. These objects, as you may have guessed, contain data about a request or response that a server sent or received. When you create an application, run it, and open the URL (<code class="language-python">127.0.0.1:5000</code>), the browser sends a request that is logged in the console right away. If everything is fine, you will see the <code class="language-python">200</code> response status code:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="160" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7cabe99a-42a2-4a5f-a52d-77bc6bc9b48a/" width="800"></p>

<p>You can see that first is the IP address of the client who accessed our application (<code class="language-python">127.0.0.1</code>), the time at which the request was received, the request type, the requested address, and the final server response — an HTTP code.</p>

<p>All these things are available in Flask thanks to a library called <a target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/#:~:text=Werkzeug%20is%20a%20comprehensive%20WSGI,most%20advanced%20WSGI%20utility%20libraries.&amp;text=A%20threaded%20WSGI%20server%20for%20use%20while%20developing%20applications%20locally." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Werkzeug</a>. We will mention it here and there because Flask basically draws on it. We'll cover the library in detail in later topics, but now it is important (and enough) for us to say that Werkzeug provides a set of utilities to enable a Python application to communicate to a web server by processing and requests and responses.</p>

<h5 id="processing-requests">Processing requests</h5>

<p>Now, let's write our own application that will handle requests and see how can we process them. Imagine that we want to create an authorization system. What do we need? That's right — a page that will have a form for a username and password. It will send the data to the server as an authentication request. </p>

<p>Firstly, we need to import Flask as well as <code class="language-python">request</code>, a new object we will work with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from flask import Flask
from flask import request</code></pre>

<p>The imported <code class="language-python">request</code> is a <strong>global object</strong> that is used by Flask to put the correct incoming request data in it. The <code class="language-python">request</code> object is an instance of a built-in <code class="language-python">Request</code> (note the capital letter!) subclass. Since we are not sending but mostly accepting requests, we don't need to create any new instances. It may sound a bit confusing, but at this point, let's carry on with the global object idea.</p>

<p>Once the import is complete, we can create our application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">app = Flask('main')</code></pre>

<p>Ok, the foundation is ready, now it's time to build the main part of the program. Before writing a function, we route<strong> </strong>the page using the familiar decorator. Note that this time, we add the <code class="language-python">methods</code> parameter to show Flask which requests our app will accept:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@app.route('/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])</code></pre>

<p>Flask route only answers to <code class="language-python">GET</code> requests by default. To make the route able to handle other types of requests, you shall pass them in to the <code class="language-python">methods</code> list when defining the decorator.</p>

<p>Now, let's declare a <strong>view function</strong> called <code class="language-python">login</code>. </p>

<p>With the help of the <code class="language-python">method</code> attribute of the <code class="language-python">request</code> object, we can determine the request type and specify the behavior of the application: </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def login():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        template = """
        &lt;form method='POST'&gt;
        &lt;input type='text' placeholder='Username...'&gt;
        &lt;input type='password' placeholder='Password...'&gt;
        &lt;input type='submit' value='Auth'&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        """
        return template

    elif request.method == 'POST':
        return 'Wow! Great, you logged in!'</code></pre>

<p>We have created a template that we are going to show on the login page. You'll study building and showing templates in detail later, so for now, you can just copy and paste the template string into your code to make everything work.</p>

<p>Finally, let's launch our app:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">app.run()</code></pre>

<h5 id="what-it-looks-like">What it looks like</h5>

<p>Run the program and make sure that everything works. You will see the following messages in the console:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="136" src="https://ucarecdn.com/c2152a9a-2979-4355-ac4a-37ec884734fa/" width="738"></p>

<p>Now we can go to the app page and see how everything works:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/fcaf5dc2-f643-4fa3-a7a3-2ef8d1b066af/"></p>

<p>If we enter some data (even though for now it is just a formality, as the authorization system is not implemented) and click on the button, we will see the message that we specified earlier:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8792b390-41b5-4385-a19e-e4c2a4b604b3/"></p>

<p>Wonderful! We can use the conditional construction and the <code class="language-python">request</code> object, the <code class="language-python">method</code> attribute in particular, to determine whether users send data to us or just want to see a web page. Below you can see the entire code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from flask import request
from flask import Flask


app = Flask('main')

@app.route('/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        template = """
        &lt;form method='POST'&gt;
        &lt;input type='text' placeholder='Username...'&gt;
        &lt;input type='password' placeholder='Password...'&gt;
        &lt;input type='submit' value='Auth'&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        """
        return template

    elif request.method == 'POST':
        return 'Wow! Great, you logged in!'


app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>Besides <code class="language-python">method</code> attribute, the request object has a few more frequently used properties. We will cover some of them in following topics, but if you're curious now, you can check out <a target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/api/#flask.Request" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this part</a> of the documentation.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>In this topic, we have found out that we work with requests and responses as with objects in Flask. We have also learned how to process different types of requests with a view function and return different messages. Let's go and practice what we have learned!</p>
